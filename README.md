# ShinyNetSurvey
An interactive network survey application built in RShiny. 

Install the shiny and rdrop2 packages in order to use this app and the Rshiny Code Writer.

It is recommended that you use dropbox to save your survey results. If you are using dropbox, make sure your working directory is set to the location of the app, then need to run drop_auth() and give access to the app. 
#If access is denied, reset working directory then run drop_auth(new_user=T).
